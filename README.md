# diff2html example

Example:

https://kevinsimper.github.io/diff2html-example/#!/kevinsimper/hyper-dashboard/commit/7295644edee5ab8d340988ae7d128422de8e83b4.diff

You can see that the url contains a relative url on github, this link:

https://github.com/kevinsimper/hyper-dashboard/commit/7295644edee5ab8d340988ae7d128422de8e83b4

The way it works it that ".diff" is appended and github.com is removed.
